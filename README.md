# Prueba-M2-HTML

# In this readme will see the step by step description of The web portfolio code
  Start with the basic syntax for the 3 HTML files: index, portfolio, and contact.

# Index:
  For the index the first thing that was done was to join it with the css file through a link href , then in the header it has the title (H1) and the navigation buttons with a class to later edit the style in css
  Continue with the main where a section was created on me, it includes a title (h2) and a small description about me,
  Close the section and the main, to add a footer and close the entire body with the index syntax

# Portfolio: 
  For the portfolio syntax started doing the same of the index with the navigation bar in the header, then in the main started to describe all the personal projects, using a title (h3), a small description of the project and with a href add a   link that takes us to the repository where the project is

# Contact:
  Basic syntax with the navigation bar and the only thing use in this file is a form where it has 3 labels: name, email and a message; additional a button to send the information that the user entered before


# CSS:

Used general styles how **font family, background, margin, padding, font size, text align**, for all pages

For the portfolio used background color, a small transition and button animation with the hover

Added **shadows, colors, aligned text to the center, font size, and animated buttons** for the contact form page

Navigation style menu with animations, transitions, color changes, and font and size changes

Animation of navigation buttons with a hover

Responsive design with media queries
  
**max-width** and automatic margins ('margin: 0 auto') were used to center the containers.  
**Media queries** were applied to improve display on small screens.
